# Sentiment-Analysis-with-BERT-Guided-Project-
Welcome to my first guided project focused on Google's BERT (Bidirectional Encoder-Decoder from Transformers). This marks my initial exploration into transformers, and I am thrilled to share my insights with you! The code for preprocessing and modelling used in this project is primarily taken from a course available on Udemy: [Learn BERT - most powerful NLP algorithm by Google](https://www.udemy.com/course/bert-nlp-algorithm/learn/lecture/29758070?start=1#reviews) by Martin Jocqueviel. The course has been a great resource for my undertanding of how transformers operate in the context of language processing. After this project, my intention is to further work with BERT and learn its aplications in text generation for question answering and text summarization!

This current project is focused on sentiment analysis of Tweets. "Sentiment analysis is the process of analyzing digital text to determine if the emotional tone of the message is positive, negative, or neutral" [Link](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/sentiment-analysis/). It has various applications in commercial sphere and most notable is using sentiment analysis to undertand customers/users' attitude towards a service or product to improve it [Link](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/sentiment-analysis/).

The dataset for this project comes from Kaggle, titled [Twitter Sentiment Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jp797498e/twitter-entity-sentiment-analysis). Comprising over 70,000 entries, the dataset contains four distinct sentiment categories: Positive, Negative, Neutral, and Irrelevant. The subsequent code provided will guide you through data visualization and preprocessing steps. This process is crucial to gaining a comprehensive understanding of the dataset for subsequent modeling. Links will be provided for outside code taken from similar projects.
